#A Great! First Date

This is [agreatfirstdate.com](https://agreatfirstdate.com/)'s next product release. We are starting with Bootstrap 3, Angularjs using the [Angularjs Seed Project](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed/), Compass and SCSS that is a bit SMACSSish. We are considering a [MEAN](http://mean.io/) stack for the application, but for now will prototype with Angularjs and the provided Node.js web server, Karma for unit tests and the Angularjs baked-in end-to-end test runner. [Vanilla version viewable here.](http://www.agreatfirstdate.com.php53-5.dfw1-2.websitetestlink.com/)
